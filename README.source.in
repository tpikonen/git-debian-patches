Notes on this Debian source package
===================================

Source package format
---------------------

These sources are packaged in the standard '3.0 (quilt)' dpkg source
format. The patches in 'debian/patches' are generated from the package
git repository (see the Vcs-Git field in debian/control) by diffing
the 'upstream' branch with the patch branch ('p/*').

Making a change to the package sources does not require working with the git
repository. The package can be changed in a normal way by either adding a new
patch to 'debian/patches' or by changing the sources directly and letting
dpkg-source build the additional patch during source package creation.

Working with the packaging git repository
-----------------------------------------

The 'master' branch of the git repository always contains the complete patched
sources, ready to be built by 'debuild -i\.git' or a similar command.
Commits modifying the upstream sources should go to the master branch
and also be cherry picked to a specific patch branch, in order to be
included in a separate patch file in the source package. Upstream modifying
commits not included in any of the patch branches will be placed by
dpkg-source to the catchall patch 'debian/patches/debian-changes-{version}',
but having this patch in a released version is discouraged.

The generated patches and the order of patch application are determined
by DEP-3 header information files in 'debian/metapatches', with file names
having the format 'nn_patchname'. The number 'nn' determines the order of the
patch in the series. An extra header field 'X-git-branch' in the
metapatch file points to the git branch used to generate the patch file.

Some scripts to automate the patch and series file generation and other tasks
can be found at http://gitorious.org/gdp
